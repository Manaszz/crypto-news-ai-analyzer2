# Progress: Crypto News MCP Server

## 1. Current Status

The foundational structure of the server is now in place. The initial template has been refactored, and the core services, models, and MCP tool definitions have been implemented. The service layer contains placeholder logic that needs to be connected to the Perplexity API client.

- **Completed**:
    - Project initialized from template.
    - Memory Bank created.
    - Detailed development plan formulated.
    - **Task 0: Project Setup and Architecture Analysis**: Completed project refactoring, including package renaming and cleanup of demo code.
    - **Task 1 & 5 (Initial): Core Service and Tool Implementation**:
        - Created all required model classes (`NewsItem`, `SentimentScore`, etc.).
        - Implemented `NewsItemRepository` for data access.
        - Created `NewsAnalyticsService` and `SentimentAnalyzer` service shells.
        - Defined all 10 MCP functions in `CryptoNewsTools.java`.
        - Configured `PerplexityApiProperties` and `CachingConfig`.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Full Perplexity API Integration**: Implement the `PerplexityNewsClient` to make real API calls.
- **Service Logic**: Flesh out the business logic within `NewsAnalyticsService` for all 10 MCP tools.
- **Sentiment Analysis Engine**: Connect the `SentimentAnalyzer` to an actual sentiment analysis implementation.
- **Transport Layers**: Implement STDIO, HTTP, and SSE transport layers.
- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for the new services and tools.
- **Documentation**: Update API documentation and user guides.

## 3. Known Issues

- The `NewsAnalyticsService` contains only placeholder method implementations.
- The `PerplexityNewsClient` is not yet implemented.
- Linter is showing errors for `FunctionCallbackWrapper` despite a successful Maven build. This is likely an IDE/tooling issue.
- Perplexity API key is not yet configured.
